    <h1 align = "center">Why NFT for Musicians?</h1>
    <div style = "padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px">
        <h2>Monetization</h2>
        <p>There are a few aspects of NFTs that make them highly appealing for musicians. The first is financial: NFTs have been selling at extremely high prices. Superstar artists, like Kings of Leon and Steve Aoki, have sold NFTs for millions of dollars. Even lesser-known artists, such as Vérité and Zack Fox, have made tens of thousands of U.S. dollars selling NFTs. The artist Young and Sick had only 27,000 followers on Instagram when he sold an NFT for $865,000.</p>

        <p>These numbers are incredible, especially when you compare them with the payout rate of streaming platforms. Streaming platforms have been one of the main revenue sources for musicians in the digital age, and became even more so during the COVID-19 pandemic last year when live show revenue dried up. The payout rates of these platforms, however, is still not very high. This has been a hot topic since their creation. Spotify pays out on average around $0.003 to $0.005 per stream. That equates to around $3,000 to $5,000 for 1 million streams, but 1 million is a large number for an independent artist.</p>
        
        <h2>Diversifcation</h2>
        <p>
            Musicians are able to diversify their portfolios of artwork outside of music. For example, on the top of our music NFT ranking, Grimes, Steve Aoki, and Eminem all sold artworks that are not music albums. Grimes sold animation and picture; Steve Aoki worked with top 3D animators for his NFTs; Eminem sold vintage toys as his NFTs. It is another way of releasing colletibles for the musician's fans. Selling NFTs open new opportunities to make buying collectibles from the musician more "fun". For example, you can purchase a pack of NFTs and there are chances where you can get a really rare one (which would worth more), or even a chance to virtually interact with the artist.
        </p>
        <h2>New Fans</h2>
        <p>
            THe blockchain community is an early and also a tight-knited community. People within the blockchain community are quite open to exposing artists who does activitly engage in the blockchain community, because they would like the influencers to help them promote the idea of blockchain applications to the general public. We have seen a significant growth in numbers in the people who are invested in cryptocurrencies and activiely engage in the blockchain community; therefore, it is safe to say that artists who does release NFTs would attract more fans and be viewed as following a current trend. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, as now artists can treat songs as equity investments — they can create an NFT and give away 30% ownership of a song. This gives those contributing money a chance to get an actual return on their investment, while the artist gets money in their pocket. This is like a more rewarding version of a crowdfunding site.
