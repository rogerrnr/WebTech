	<h1>Question 3</h1>
	<p>Modify this page so that the following animation starts when the button is clicked (4 pts). Every 500 milliseconds, the number in the h2 tag should decrease by 1 (8 pts).  When the number reaches 0, the animation should stop (8 points).  HINT: I have included a variable called counter that you can use if you want.  If the user had changed the ending value in the input box before clicking the button, the animation will stop when the countdown reaches that number (5 points).  You may assume that the entry in the input box is an integer between 19 and 0 inclusive.</p>
