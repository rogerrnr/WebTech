	<h1>Question 4</h1>
	<p>When the Deal key is pressed, two cards are drawn at random using letters and numbers from the ranks array (already created for you) to replace the aa and cc in the paragraph below the line, and words from the suits array (also already created for you) to replace the bb and dd in the paragraph below (15 pts).  If the two cards dealt are the same, the function will deal the second card again without the user having to click the button (10 pts). It's possible that after the second deal the two cards are still the same, but that's OK. </p>
